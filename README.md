# Victron MPPT 100/20 Data Fetch and Transmission via ESP-NOW
This project interfaces a Victron MPPT 100/20 solar charge controller with an ESP32 microcontroller to fetch real-time data over UART and transmit it wirelessly using the ESP-NOW protocol. The goal is to remotely monitor key performance metrics of the solar system, such as panel voltage, battery voltage, charging current, and status, over long-range wireless communication.
## Features:

-    Fetch data from Victron MPPT 100/20: Retrieve solar and battery data via UART communication.
-    ESP-NOW wireless transmission: Send data over long-range wireless using ESP-NOW, a low-power protocol optimized for device-to-device communication.
-    Real-time monitoring: Monitor the status and performance of your solar power system remotely.
-    Low power consumption: Optimized for long-range and energy-efficient operation in outdoor or off-grid environments.

## Components:

-    Victron MPPT 100/20: Solar charge controller.
-    ESP32: Microcontroller for data collection and wireless transmission.
-    UART communication: Fetch data from the Victron MPPT.
-    ESP-NOW: Long-range wireless communication protocol for data transmission.

This project is ideal for remote solar power monitoring, energy management systems, and off-grid applications.
